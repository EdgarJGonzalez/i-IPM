We know that if we set the intercept equal to the mean $x$ in a
linear model, that we completely get rid of the correlation;
```{r}
set.seed(1001)
x <- runif(100)
y <- rpois(100,2+4*x)
g1 <- glm(y~I(x-mean(x)),family=poisson)
cov2cor(vcov(g1))  ## -0.3 correlation
```

Then the question is: can we do some kind of approximate
calculation to figure out how we can reparameterize to
get rid of the correlation?
